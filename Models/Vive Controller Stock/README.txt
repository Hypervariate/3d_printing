# Summary

Hey,

this gun controller for the HTC Vive features the geometry of a G36 rifle. I designed it specifically for use in the game Onward - other games work as well of course.
Two 3d printed parts are fixed on the right hand controller by three m3 screws. The left hand controller can be freely put in and out of the horizontal housing to reload or can be used to support vertically.

The buttstock can be removed and reatached by a simple locking mechanism, so using one handed weapons is still easily possible. There are two types of locks, one only releases when manualy opened, the other one also opens on pull. (A small spring or a piece of foam can be used to hold the lock closed). The buttstock is devided in 3 parts for use in smaller printers, so it has to be glued or bolted together.

It's more or less a prototype, so there might still be some issues (especially with the locks). Biggest part has a length of about 190mm.

enjoy


Edit; Just as a Warning: Some people have trouble using it in Onward. It will not work for all gun/sight combinations, but enough usable combinations are available on both Marsoc and Volk. I've been using it succesfully for many hours in Onward now.
